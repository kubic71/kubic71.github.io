# Blog / personal website
I finally decided to take my presence to the virtual world. This is my shot at it.

I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), because it's fast, simple and minimalistic. It is supported by the github pages out of the box. I expect to create and publish mostly plain-text/simple-markdown content, so it's perfect for my usecase.

Here's the link to my website (google refused to index it even after 1 month):
