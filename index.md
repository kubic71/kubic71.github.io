## Welcome to my home on the internet!

Warning: this site is under continuous construction.

### A: What is this site meant to be? 
I don't know yet. I have too much time on my hands (I don't really), so in a impulsive procrastination burst I finally decided to create myself a SERIOUS place on the Internet. 

### A: Is this a blog, or what?
I don't know either. To calm myself that I'm not completely useless I made an [about]({% link about_me.md %}) page with some of my accomplishments and things I have done or am currently working on. 

### A: You didn't answer the question, IS THIS A BLOG?
Well I plan to write a few blog posts, mainly as a way to capture my thoughs somewhere in a more organized and permanent manner. I am otherwise terribly disorganized character, so I hope the thought of writing something for other people will force me to express myself more clearly.
