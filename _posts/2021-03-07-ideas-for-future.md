# List of ideas

Following list contains (among other things) topics, principles, phenomena, physical laws that fascinate me and I didn't yet have time to write a full blog post about them. This list is continuously evolving. 

Some items on the lists deserve maybe only a few sentences. Some may be worthy of entire scientific fields of study.

More meaty ideas may be extended by sub-ideas.

The main purpose is to write those things down as they pop into my head, so that they are not lost in the chaos of my thoughts.


Here we go:
- **Writing as an active learning method**
    - rephrasing something serves as a check against the illusion of understanding, similarly to teaching 
    - more accurate metacognition about one's own abilities 
- **Kuramoto and the emergent synchronization** 
    - metronomes
    - coupled oscilators
    - Collective dynamics of small-world networks
    - Fireflies
    - Millenium bridge wobble
    - Menstrual synchrony
    - Time Delay in the Kuramoto Model of Coupled Oscillators 
    - Swarm robotics
    - Decentralized music playback sync (bluetooth speakers)   
    - Epilepsy
    - Heart muscle cells
    - NTP, IoT, papers [Meshed Emergent Firefly Synchronization](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224097522_Emergent_Slot_Synchronization_in_Wireless_Networks), [Estimators for Time Synchronization—Survey, Analysis, and Outlook](https://www.mdpi.com/2624-831X/1/2/23)
    - Chimera states

- **The unreasonable effectiveness of simple harmonic oscillators**
    - [The ‘Miracle’ of Applicability? The Curious Case of the Simple Harmonic Oscillator](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323833034_The_'Miracle'_of_Applicability_The_Curious_Case_of_the_Simple_Harmonic_Oscillator)


- **Applicability of knowledge**
    - usefullness of a piece of knowledge
        - d(e, p) = degree to which the principle *p* (or model, knowledge, understanding, physical/mathematical law, idea, thinking framework...) can explain event *e*
        - usefulness(p) = E \[d(e, p) / time_to_understand(p) \], e ~ event distribution - probability that event e will happen in your life.
        - heuristic that selects principles to understand should consider value function v(event), or which says how important is for me to understend event e (financially, personally)

- **The unreasonable effectiveness of random exploration**
    - the unexpected and fundamentally unpredictable positive consequences of random exploration. How to fight sterile order by carefully crafted disorder. 
    - exploration vs. exploitation tradeoff

- **My vision of myself hinders my own progress**
    - My own perceived identity is the biggest obstacle to changing my behavior and habit (https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299)
