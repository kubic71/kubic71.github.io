## Meaning of life
### Source of motivation
Meaning and purpose in life is like a guiding compass that gives you direction in life and helps you overcome unavoidable harsh struggles. It is the ultimate motivating factor. Not having a meaning runs the risk of doing things that are easy and plesurable short-term but lead nowhere in the long-run. Do things for the right reasons, things that are in line with your meaning nad purpose, things that you won't regret when you are in your 80s.

### Choices
With every action taken you are casting a vote for the person you will become. You only have finite amount of votes, choose them wisely. Don't let laziness compromise your integrity. Before you do anything, ask yourself honestly: To the best of my knowledge, is this the most efficient way of serving my ultimate goals?

### Games
Solid core values that you stand by build powerful shield against temptations that derail you. Don't play other people's games when that game isn't compatible with your's. Choose to play yours.


### Accept that your beliefs will change
Your values may change as you get older and gain more experience and wisdom, but having a well though-out list of the ultimate goals which you tweak as you go through life is incredibly useful nevertheless. Having a purpose is essential to living valuable and fulfilled life.


## Be kind to the people you love
Build love and friendships with trust, honesty and sacrifice. Love is not a game, you cannot cheat your way around it. The only way to find true love is to sacrifice yourself unconditionally. Open yourself with all your strenghts and vulnerabilities. Maybe it will work out, maybe not, but there is no love without commitment, risk and skin in the game.

## Be hopeful and optimistic
Using hate and jealousy as a driving force is undoubtedly very effective and can make you achieve great things. The powerful nature of hate is also the reason why it is so hard to avoid it. The deeper you get into the darkness the harder it is to see the light. At some point the snowball is too big to stop. But you can choose to stop the snowball early when it's easy. I haven't stopped many snowballs and let them roll for a long time, I know how it feels to get absorbed by hate, but I realized I have a choice when I notice the snowball just starting to form. I hope I will always choose to stop it. I want to choose good and love.


## Go full in
Life is too short to play it safe. Have skin in the game. Take risks. Surviving is not living. There are no ups without downs, no highs without lows, no wins without losses.

## Learn about the world
Appreciate the beauty of the world. The process of discovering and understanding unlocks new levels and dimensions in the game of life. The investment compounds and pays off in unexpectable ways. 

## Build and create things for others
Building and creating is infinitely more meaningful and satisfying than consuming. Although building in and of itself is meaningful, sharing it with others takes it to another level. We want to have an impact on this world and create things that will last. Be immortal by leaving a legacy and by living in the hearts and minds of others after you leave this place.

## Be honest with yourself and others. Don't explain your philosophy. Embody it
Avoid self-deception at all costs. Being honest with yourself can be hard at the beginning, but ultimately it is one of the most liberating things. Actively find and fight your cognitive disonance. Don't blame others. Don't be jealous. Start with yourself. Be humble.

## Embrace the struggle
Suffering and pain is unavoidable. Doing the right things is usually harder than doing the easy things. What makes the struggle bearable is giving it a meaning. Pain can become pleasure by looking at it from different perspective. Suffering is necessary, but don't suffer just for the sake of suffering. Nihilism is paralizing. Be optimistic. Suffer for a reason.


He who has a why to live can bear almost any how. (Friedrich Nietzsche)
